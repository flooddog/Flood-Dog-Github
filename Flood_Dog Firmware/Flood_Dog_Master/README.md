# Connected Counter for the new Particle Gen 3 Device - Boron

This is a robust sketch to collect counts and reports them to Ubidots using a Particle webhook

The idea is that this device can operate at low power for solar operation.  It counts events (RISING) from a connected sensor and reports data hourly.  The sensors can be PIR for people counting, pressure for cars or accelerometers for bikes.

See the file 3rdGenDevicePinoutDoc for the pin connections
