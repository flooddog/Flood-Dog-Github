# Connected Water Level Sensor Kit for the Particle Gen 3 Device - Boron

This is a robust sketch to collect water level data and reports them to Ubidots using a Particle webhook. This script is a version of the Visitation-Counter v36.

The idea is that this device can operate at low power for solar operation.  It counts events (RISING) from a connected sensor and reports data hourly.  The sensors can be PIR for people counting, pressure for cars or accelerometers for bikes.
